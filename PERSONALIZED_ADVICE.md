# Personalized Financial Advice - Enhanced Chatbot ðŸŽ¯

Your financial advisor chatbot now provides **deeply personalized advice** based on a user's complete life situation!

## What's New

### Personal Context Fields

The chatbot now accepts detailed user information to provide life-stage-appropriate advice:

#### Demographics
- **age** - Life stage considerations
- **relationship_status** - "single", "married", "partnered", etc.
- **kids** - Boolean or descriptive (e.g., "2 kids (ages 5, 7)")

#### Financial Situation
- **annual_income** - Current income level
- **savings** - Available cash/liquid assets
- **debt** - Outstanding debt (student loans, car, etc.)
- **credit_score** - Creditworthiness

#### Career & Education
- **education** - Educational background
- **job_stability** - "stable", "startup", "freelance", "contract"
- **career_stage** - "early career", "mid-career", "senior", "executive"

#### Location & Lifestyle
- **location** - City/region for market-specific insights
- **work_situation** - "remote", "hybrid", "in-office"
- **lifestyle_priorities** - What matters most to them

#### Property Information
- **property_links** - Zillow, StreetEasy, or other listing URLs (string or array)
- **additional_info** - Any other relevant context

## Enhanced System Prompt

The AI now considers:

### Life Stage Guidance
- **Young Professionals (20s-early 30s)**: Flexibility, career mobility, debt management
- **Established Professionals (30s-40s)**: Stability vs opportunity cost, family needs
- **Families with Kids**: School districts, space, long-term stability
- **Pre-retirement (50s-60s)**: Downsizing, equity, fixed income planning

### Personalization Factors
- **Job Stability**: Unstable = favor renting for flexibility
- **Family Plans**: Kids soon? Consider schools and space
- **Income Trajectory**: High growth = can absorb mortgage risk
- **Debt Levels**: High debt = build savings first
- **Location**: High-cost cities = longer break-even
- **Lifestyle**: Value travel? Renting fits better

### Property Link Analysis
When you provide Zillow or StreetEasy links, the AI can:
- Search for market insights and trends
- Consider neighborhood characteristics
- Evaluate property-specific factors

## Frontend Integration

### Collecting User Context

Here's a React example for collecting this information:

```typescript
interface UserContext {
  age?: number;
  annual_income?: number;
  relationship_status?: string;
  kids?: boolean | string;
  education?: string;
  job_stability?: string;
  career_stage?: string;
  savings?: number;
  debt?: number;
  credit_score?: number;
  location?: string;
  work_situation?: string;
  lifestyle_priorities?: string;
  property_links?: string | string[];
  additional_info?: string;
}

// Multi-step onboarding form
function UserContextForm({ onSubmit }) {
  const [context, setContext] = useState<UserContext>({});

  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => onSubmit(context)}>
      <h2>Tell us about yourself</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Basic Info</h3>
        <input
          type="number"
          placeholder="Age"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, age: parseInt(e.target.value)})}
        />
        <select onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, relationship_status: e.target.value})}>
          <option>Single</option>
          <option>Married</option>
          <option>Partnered</option>
        </select>
        <input
          placeholder="Kids? (e.g., '2 kids, ages 5 and 7')"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, kids: e.target.value})}
        />
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Financial Situation</h3>
        <input
          type="number"
          placeholder="Annual Income"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, annual_income: parseFloat(e.target.value)})}
        />
        <input
          type="number"
          placeholder="Savings"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, savings: parseFloat(e.target.value)})}
        />
        <input
          type="number"
          placeholder="Total Debt"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, debt: parseFloat(e.target.value)})}
        />
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Property Info (Optional)</h3>
        <input
          placeholder="Zillow/StreetEasy link"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, property_links: e.target.value})}
        />
        <input
          placeholder="Location (e.g., 'Austin, TX')"
          onChange={(e) => setContext({...context, location: e.target.value})}
        />
      </section>

      <button type="submit">Get Personalized Advice</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Sending Request with Context

```typescript
async function getAdvice(
  question: string,
  inputs: any,
  userContext: UserContext,
  conversationHistory: Message[]
) {
  const response = await fetch('/v1/advise', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      question,
      inputs,
      user_context: userContext,
      conversation_history: conversationHistory
    })
  });

  return await response.json();
}
```

## Testing

Run the personalized test script to see how advice changes based on different profiles:

```bash
export PPLX_API_KEY="your-key"
python test_chatbot_personalized.py
```

This will simulate 4 different scenarios:
1. Young tech professional considering first home
2. Married couple with young kids needing space
3. Pre-retirement couple looking to downsize
4. Recent grad facing parental pressure to buy

## Best Practices

### Progressive Disclosure
Don't overwhelm users - collect context progressively:
1. Start with basic question
2. If they engage, ask for key details (age, income, family)
3. If they're serious, collect full financial picture
4. Always make fields optional

### Privacy & Security
- Never store sensitive financial info without consent
- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider encrypting context data in transit
- Allow users to clear their context
- Be transparent about how data is used

### UX Tips
- Pre-fill context from previous sessions (with permission)
- Offer quick personas: "I'm a young professional", "I have kids", etc.
- Allow editing context mid-conversation
- Show which context fields influence advice
- Let users paste property URLs directly in chat

## Benefits of Personalization

### For Users
- More relevant, actionable advice
- Life-stage-appropriate recommendations
- Feels like talking to a real advisor
- Addresses their specific concerns
- Considers trade-offs beyond just numbers

### For Your Product
- Higher engagement and trust
- Better conversion rates
- Fewer generic responses
