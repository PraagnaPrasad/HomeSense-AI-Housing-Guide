# Equity & Wealth Tracking - Fixed! ‚úÖ

The calculator now properly accounts for equity building and wealth accumulation on both sides!

## The Problem (Before)

The old calculation had a **critical flaw**:

```python
# Old method
total_rent_paid = sum(all rent payments)
total_own_paid = sum(all ownership costs) - net_proceeds  # Equity subtracted here!
```

### Why This Was Misleading

1. **Ignored opportunity cost** - Didn't account for what renters could do with their down payment
2. **Asymmetric comparison** - Credited owners for equity but not renters for investments
3. **Wealth not visible** - Equity was hidden as a "cost reduction" rather than shown as wealth
4. **Misleading conclusions** - Made buying look cheaper even when renting built more wealth

### Example of the Problem

**Scenario**: $650k home, $3k/month rent, 10 years
- Old result: "Owning costs $400k, Renting costs $413k - Buy wins!"
- **Reality**: Renter has $535k in investments, Owner has $374k equity - Rent wins!

## The Solution (Now)

### New Wealth-Based Comparison

The calculator now tracks **THREE dimensions**:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cash Spent (Out-of-Pocket)
- **Renting**: Total rent paid over time
- **Owning**: Down payment + closing + all ongoing costs

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wealth Accumulated
- **Renter**: Investment portfolio value
  - Starts with down payment they didn't spend
  - Adds monthly savings (when rent < ownership costs)
  - Compounds at `investment_return` rate
- **Owner**: Home equity
  - Starts with down payment
  - Grows through principal paydown + appreciation
  - Minus selling costs

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Net Position
- **Formula**: `Cash Spent - Wealth Accumulated`
- **Winner**: Lowest net position (or highest wealth advantage)

## New API Response Fields

### Backwards Compatible (Legacy)
```json
{
  "total_rent_paid": 413700,  // Old method
  "total_own_paid": 400500    // Old method (includes equity credit)
}
```

### New Wealth-Based Fields
```json
{
  // Cash flows
  "total_rent_cash_spent": 413700,
  "total_own_cash_spent": 732235,

  // Wealth positions
  "renter_net_worth": 534619,      // Investment portfolio
  "owner_net_worth": 373948,       // Home equity (after selling costs)

  // True cost comparison
  "total_rent_true_cost": -121919, // Negative = made money!
  "total_own_true_cost": 358287,

  // Bottom line
  "wealth_advantage": -160671,     // Negative = renter advantage

  // Time series
  "renter_savings_series": [180145, 212284, ...],  // Year by year
  "equity_series": [154820, 180587, ...]            // Year by year
}
```

## How The Renter's Portfolio Works

```python
# Year 0
renter_portfolio = down_payment + closing_cost  # Money not spent

# Each year
monthly_diff = owner_monthly_cost - monthly_rent
if monthly_diff > 0:  # If owning costs more
    annual_savings = monthly_diff * 12
else:
    annual_savings = 0

renter_portfolio = renter_portfolio * (1 + investment_return) + annual_savings
```

### Key Assumptions
- **Investment return**: Default 4% (historically 7-10% for stocks, 4% is conservative)
- **Renter invests surplus**: If rent < ownership costs, difference goes to investments
- **Compound returns**: Portfolio grows exponentially
- **Liquid wealth**: Renter can access money anytime (owner's equity is locked)

## Visualizing the Comparison

### Example Output (10-year scenario)

```
CASH SPENT:
  ‚Ä¢ Renting: $413,700
  ‚Ä¢ Owning: $732,235

WEALTH ACCUMULATED:
  ‚Ä¢ Renter (invested savings): $534,619
  ‚Ä¢ Owner (home equity): $373,948

NET POSITION (Cash Spent - Wealth):
  ‚Ä¢ Renting: $-121,919  ‚Üê Negative means GAINED wealth!
  ‚Ä¢ Owning: $358,287

üí∞ RENTER ADVANTAGE: $160,671 more wealth
```

### Year-by-Year Breakdown

| Year | Owner Equity | Renter Portfolio | Owner Advantage |
|------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1    | $154,820     | $180,145         | $-25,325        |
| 2    | $180,587     | $212,284         | $-31,697        |
| 5    | $264,001     | $318,545         | $-54,544        |
| 10   | $426,360     | $534,619         | $-108,259       |

## What Drives the Winner?

### Buying Wins When:
- ‚úÖ Home appreciation > investment returns
- ‚úÖ Long holding period (15+ years)
- ‚úÖ Low rent growth
- ‚úÖ Low mortgage rates
- ‚úÖ Strong local real estate market

### Renting Wins When:
- ‚úÖ Investment returns > home appreciation
- ‚úÖ Short holding period (<7 years)
- ‚úÖ High mortgage rates
- ‚úÖ High transaction costs (buying/selling)
- ‚úÖ Strong stock market returns

## Testing

Run the demonstration:

=== CALCULATION RESULTS ===

CASH SPENT:
  ‚Ä¢ Renting: $413,700
  ‚Ä¢ Owning: $732,235

WEALTH ACCUMULATED:
  ‚Ä¢ Renter (invested savings): $534,619
  ‚Ä¢ Owner (home equity): $373,948

NET POSITION (Cash Spent - Wealth):
  ‚Ä¢ Renting: $-121,919
  ‚Ä¢ Owning: $358,287

üí∞ RENTER ADVANTAGE: $160,671 more wealth
```

This allows for **much more nuanced advice**:

‚ùå **Old advice**: "Buying is cheaper by $13k"

‚úÖ **New advice**: "While buying has lower cashflow in later years, renting actually builds $161k more wealth over 10 years because you can invest your down payment at 7% returns versus 3% home appreciation. If you're comfortable with stock market investing and want liquidity, renting is financially superior here."

## Migration Guide

### If You Were Using Old Fields

```typescript
// Old way (still works, but misleading)
const oldWinner = result.total_own_paid < result.total_rent_paid ? 'buy' : 'rent';

// New way (accurate)
const newWinner = result.wealth_advantage > 0 ? 'buy' : 'rent';
const advantage = Math.abs(result.wealth_advantage);
```

### Recommended Display

```tsx
function ResultSummary({ result }) {
  const winner = result.wealth_advantage > 0 ? 'Buying' : 'Renting';
  const loser = winner === 'Buying' ? 'Renting' : 'Buying';

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{winner} Wins</h2>
      <p>
        {winner} builds <strong>${Math.abs(result.wealth_advantage).toLocaleString()}</strong>
        {' '}more wealth than {loser.toLowerCase()} over {years} years.
      </p>
